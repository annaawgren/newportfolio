        Typically when you enter a hotel room anywhere in the world you get a similar experience.
        A nice clean room. But one that is quiet and "cold". W hotels asked us to help them change
        that with music, color and emotion. Their London hotel was undergoing major renovations in
        2019 and became the perfect location to try out our new solution.
        We designed a never before seen music interface for iPad and TV.

      <p className="untitled-text text-md indent mb-8">
        I did the UI based on the idea that the interaction should
        feel organic and fluid â€“ like an emotion. Like a lava lamp or liquid light show.
