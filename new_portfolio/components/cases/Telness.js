        As a Designer at digital product studio Department I was responsible for
        evolving the telecom company Telness’ design system – to make their
        visual identity more warm and welcoming. Here are some snapshots from
        the design process where I overlooked all the design components, how to
        work with typography, adding more colors, pictograms, speech bubbles and
        animated arrows for example. I also worked with the Telness tonality and
        falicitated workshops with the client. Read more about the Telness
        project: department.se/work/telness See the implemented design here:
