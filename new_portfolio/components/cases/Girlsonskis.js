        As a Designer and Frontend Developer at Digital Product Studio
        Department I was part of designing an interface for a mood based
        playlist picker and an in-room music experience for W Hotels. I did the
        UI design and came up with the idea that the player should feel organic
        and fluid – like an emotion – when you move your finger over the iPad.
        Like a lava lamp or liquid light show, that changes color depending on
        what mood the guest chooses. Then my colleague Fredrik built an
        absolutely fantastic solution.
