        I am co-founder of Newbie Tech Exploration Lab where we facilitate
        hands-on creative tech workshops for beginners. We started Newbie Tech
        because we wanted to lower the threshold and create opportunities for
        tech newbies to explore â€“ and have fun! Also because we are forever
        curious and passionate about exploring emerging technologies. Up until
        now we have facilitated workshops in Machine Learning as a creative tool
        and I designed and built our homepage newbietech.io. <br />
        Every second sunday we also do an online Sunday Session where we explore
        and learn emerging technologies such as for example AR-filters for
        mobile with Spark AR and Machine Learning with Runway ML.
